# Non Linear Least Squares optimization + Iterative Closest Point algorithm
This project is on Non Linear Least Squares optimization and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Non Linear Least Squares optimization is done on synthesized data (Gaussian function and other non-linear function) using methods like Gradient Descent optimization, Gauss-Newton optimization and Levenberg Marquardt (LM) optimization. ICP is done on input point clouds to find the transformation matrix between them using procrustes alignment using closest point correspondences.
